# Life Tracker

This is an Android app that derives from my django project [life](https://github.com/roger-mengqiu-chen/life).

Although django application is good enough for local desktop environment. I feel it's better to create a mobile app for it. Since I don't have any experience of Android development. This is a good starting point.
